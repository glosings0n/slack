**Slack Profile**
The App called "Slack Profile" has simple functionality:
1. When opening the app, we have a Welcome page which gives you an idea about the app;
2. Then by clicking on the "Start" button, you go to the Home page, where we have the main purpose of the app, with a button at the bottom that returns to a WebView, the developer's "GitHub" window that I am, from this window, we are offered an “Arrow Back” button which takes you back to the Home page.
There is also a small "Skip" button on the Home page that allows you to return to the Welcome page.
...
If I can give some hypotheses, I will cite:
1. Image downloading may be slow;
2. Downloading the "GitHub" page may also take a while;
...
A final note may be that the app works with the device theme.
Thanks you!
